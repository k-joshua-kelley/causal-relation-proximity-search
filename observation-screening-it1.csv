Do Consumers Value Environmental Innovation in Product.txt,"As a result, besides price and quality preferences, consumer choices are influenced by environmental and ethical considerations (Sehgal and Singh 2010), which has translated into a growing demand for environmentally friendly products and services (Brosdahl and Carpenter 2010) and, conversely , decreasing demand for those products and services with a questionable social and environmental impact (Kassinis and Soteriou 2003). These changing consumer demands force companies to modify their products and processes looking for innovative ways to reduce or eliminate their adverse effects on the natural environment in order to avoid losing their customer base (Hojnik and Ruzzier 2016). In this regard, most environmentally friendly products are based on technological innovations in their development process aimed at reducing the negative environmental impacts throughout their whole life cycle (Kesidou and Demirel 2012; Cheng et al. 2014), so that they are often considered innovations in the market (Shim et al. 2018).","In this regard, most environmentally friendly products are based on technological innovations in their development process aimed at reducing the negative environmental impacts throughout their whole life cycle (Kesidou and Demirel 2012; Cheng et al",yes,yes,no,

Does astronomy generate economic benefits Technological innovation seen through the lens of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope.txt," In the context of transnational science proj ects, usually in the category of big science  projects, public funding agencies want to know what types of industrial benefits these government-funded large-scale scientific projects can generate. Their reasoning is that this information could help them to better utilise their national industrial home base (Nordberg, 1994).  Traditionally, research about the economic impact of big science has been focused in  fields such as particle physics (Autio et al ., 2003; Autio et al., 2004 ; Bianchi-Streit et al.,  1984; Hähnle, 1997; Nordberg, 1994; Schmied, 1977; Vuola and Hameric, 2006) and space exploration (Nordberg, 1994 ). In contrast, the economi c impact of astronomy or  astronomy projects has not been a frequent subject of study. Publications about the impact of astronomy have been limited to a small number of studies and reports (AASTA, 2007; ARA Group, 1999; BPA, 2001 ; CASCA, 2008; Greenway and Burnett,  2004; NRAO, 2006) and to disperse academic contributions (Martin and Irvine, 1981; Vicino, 1990; Vigroux, 2009).","Traditionally, research about the economic impact of big science has been focused in  fields such as particle physics (Autio et al ., 2003; Autio et al., 2004 ; Bianchi-Streit et al.,  1984; Hähnle, 1997; Nordberg, 1994; Schmied, 1977; Vuola and Hameric, 2006) and space exploration (Nordberg, 1994 )",no,,,

Economic analysis of demand uncertainty and delayed information sharing in a third-party managed supply chain.txt,"A SCM starts raw materials procurement and production process based on expected demand and takes financial risks associated with demand uncertainty. But a retailer often delays sharing product design information with SCM forcing it to expedite production and distribution  processes incurring additional financial penalties. To analyse economic impact of delayed information  sharing under uncertain demand, we develop a mathematical model. Our model indicates that higher demand volatility lessens the effect of penalty associated with delayed information sharing for retailers. The model also shows that for a given demand volatility, per-unit premium increases asymptotically for a retailer compared to marginal production cost increase for SCM.","To analyse economic impact of delayed information  sharing under uncertain demand, we develop a mathematical model",yes,yes,yes,A SCM starts raw materials procurement and production process based on expected demand and takes financial risks associated with demand uncertainty.

It is important to understand the driving forces for product life cycle design, in ﬂuence of stake- holders and barriers in implementing environmental issues forimproved life cycle design process ( Jeganova, 2005 ). Hence, the concept of Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) was developed to overcome these issues by aiming to reduce environmental impacts caused by manufacturing activities throughout all life cycle stages while striving to maintain economic competitiveness ( Alting et al., 1997 ).It is particularly important to apply LCE concept during product design stage because research has found that up to 80% of total cost, environmental and social impacts are determined during the design stage( Charter and Tischner, 2001 ). However, despite many efforts to develop design assist tools and assessment methods aiming to reduce the negative environmental impact, the issue of increasing environmental burden is still prevalent in our society. One of the main reasons for this is because there is a growing demand for products in the market.","Hence, the concept of Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) was developed to overcome these issues by aiming to reduce environmental impacts caused by manufacturing activities throughout all life cycle stages while striving to maintain economic competitiveness ( Alting et al., 1997 ).It is particularly important to apply LCE concept during product design stage because research has found that up to 80% of total cost, environmental and social impacts are determined during the design stage( Charter and Tischner, 2001 )",no,,,

Adaptable design concept aims to reduce cost andenvironmental impact by sharing common functions and reducing number of parts needed while prolonging the life of the product ( Gu et al., 2004 ). Similarly, many eco design tools and guidelines have been developed to help designers in product development so that environmental impact can be reduced ( Luttropp and Lagerstedt, 2006 ). To perform environmental impact assessment, LCA is widely used to identify impact values of products or pro- cesses.

In addition, modern day products are by products of increasingly multi-disciplinary ap- proaches that lead to increased complexities and dif ﬁculty in product development ( Tomiyama et al., 2007 ). From LCE perspective, product complexity leads to challenges in linking environmental impacts to the relevant functions since multiple interdependent design parameters are combined to achieve a holistic functionality of the product.

This phenomenon can be explained in light of Kano ’s model because a product feature when ﬁrst introduced as an excitement feature soon becomes performance and expected fea- tures of the product and raises consumer expectations ( Kano,1984 ). Therefore, LCE concept needs to be incorporated into product design considering the changes in technology development, func- tionality and usage behaviour.

"Environmental innovation, knowledge spillovers and policy implications - A systematic review of the economic effects literature..txt","Literature background According to recent studies, three drivers of environmental innovation can be identi ﬁed (as discussed in Horbach, 2008 , and Horbach et al., 2012 ). These are: (a) Market pull factors; (b) Tech- nology push drivers and other elements useful for developing skills innovation, and; (c) Regulation for reducing public good nature andimproving environmental performance of innovations ( Marin and Lotti, 2017 ). Environmental innovations are different from other technological innovations, particularly because of the relevant impact on cleaner production variables, regional development and infrastructure ( Arbolino et al., 2018a ). The reason for this difference is that environmental innovations produce positive effects on the environment, but their impact could be negative on ﬁrms ’productivity performance ( Arbolino et al., 2017 ,2018b ). Thus, environmental regulations have been frequently criticized, as they can produce lower productivity levels (Palmer et al., 1995 ).","Environmental innovations are different from other technological innovations, particularly because of the relevant impact on cleaner production variables, regional development and infrastructure ( Arbolino et al., 2018a )",no,,,

The typical metrics for assessing public researchcommercialisation include the fees generated from licensing PRIs ’technologies or intel- lectual property (IP) to the industry and the number of new ventures created on the underlying IPs of PRIs. These primary metrics are relevant and easy to track (AUTM, 1991-2014 ).","With hefty investment in R&D in both public and private sectors, it is critical for policy makers to be able to quantify the economic impact of public-funded researchusing practical and meaningful metrics",no,,,

From objective to constituted risk - An alternative approach to safety in strategic technological innovation in the European Union.txt,"Introduction Policy-making has instituted risk as a legitimate means for discussing and debating technological innovation in our societies on the basis of risk analysis (e.g. European Commission, EC 2007a ). As technological innovation is considered the cornerstone of economic growth and competitiveness (Marklund, Vonortas, and Wessner 2009 ), the issue of risk has the potential to undermine the legitimacy of regulatory policiesand, subsequently, to endanger techno-industrial progress and the economy alike.For instance, the food crises in the European Union (EU) in the 1990s (i.e. foot andmouth disease, ‘mad cow ’disease, and dioxin-contaminated chicken) provoked the social perception that risk governance was seriously limited and that regulatorsfavoured the interests of industry to the detriment of the public interest, which ‘undermined public con ﬁdence in expert-based policy-making ’(EC 2001 , 19). *Email: hannot.rodriguez@ehu.es © 2014 Taylor & FrancisJournal of Risk Research , 2016 Vol.","As technological innovation is considered the cornerstone of economic growth and competitiveness (Marklund, Vonortas, and Wessner 2009 ), the issue of risk has the potential to undermine the legitimacy of regulatory policiesand, subsequently, to endanger techno-industrial progress and the economy alike.For instance, the food crises in the European Union (EU) in the 1990s (i.e",yes,yes,yes,"""As technological innovation is considered the cornerstone of economic growth and competitiveness (Marklund, Vonortas, and Wessner 2009 ), the issue of risk has the potential to undermine the legitimacy of regulatory policiesand, subsequently, to endanger techno-industrial progress and the economy alike."""
From objective to constituted risk - An alternative approach to safety in strategic technological innovation in the European Union.txt,"For instance, the EC claimed a decadeago that ‘Risk governance –embracing risk identi ﬁcation, assessment, management and communication –has become a crucial but often highly controversial compo- nent of public policy ’(EC 2002 , 23). In consequence, EU risk policy has evolved into more accountable, participatory and precautionary forms over the last two dec-ades (EC 2000 ,2002 ,2 1–26,2009 ), in an attempt to improve public uptake of tech- nological innovations in the framework of a knowledge-based economy (Todt 2011 ). Nevertheless, the coexistence of regulatory efforts and a major commitment to technological innovation must be taken into account in any attempt to understandand assess institutional attitudes and measures towards more drastic social demands on safety. For example, safety-related public resistance in Europe to transgenic food was considered by the then European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Pro-tection David Byrne as something ‘inconsistent if not completely irrational ’(Byrne 2003 , 2), namely as something not based on facts, or objective risks, but on scien- tiﬁc ignorance and/or cultural and political prejudices. Such attitudes appeal to science to discredit criticism of techno-industrial pro- gress and, consequently, minimize the range of possible scenarios concerning therelationships between science, technology, society and nature.","Nevertheless, the coexistence of regulatory efforts and a major commitment to technological innovation must be taken into account in any attempt to understandand assess institutional attitudes and measures towards more drastic social demands on safety",no,,,
From objective to constituted risk - An alternative approach to safety in strategic technological innovation in the European Union.txt,"Risk governanceshould thus be explicitly understood and conducted from an ampler ‘innovation gov- ernance ’perspective, meaning that the rationales and commitments behind techno- logical innovations, instrumentally concealed by the dominant ‘objective risk ’ framing, cannot be immune to open criticism and scrutiny concerning safety consti-tutions (Felt et al. 2007 ). For instance, very speculative expectations about future socio-technical scenarios, which represent a constitutive part of the legitimization and shaping of strategic technological innovations such as biotechnology (Brown 2003 ) or nanotechnology (Selin 2007 ),‘tend to be insulated from wider recognition and debate, accountability and negotiation ’(Kearnes et al. 2006 , 293), and that argu- ably constrains the emergence of more critical, or sceptical policies of techno-pro-gress and its safety.

Aware of that lack of re ﬂexivity, inclusivity and precision surrounding the justi ﬁ- cation and promotion of strategic technological innovations, the EC is currentlyclaiming the adoption of a ‘Responsible Research and Innovation ’(RRI) approach for R&D activities under the next EU Framework Programme ‘Horizon 2020 ’ (2014 –2020), which would ‘allow all societal actors (...) to work together during the whole research and innovation process in order to better align both the process and its outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of European society ’(EC 2013 , 4). As such, RRI can be characterized as an attempt to justify and guide inno- vation not on the basis of taken-for-granted macroeconomic visions and promises,but on grounds of societally bene ﬁcial objectives ( ‘right impacts ’) as openly and deliberatively de ﬁned by a heterogeneity of stakeholders (von Schomberg 2013 ). From this perspective, ‘inclusive risk governance ’(EC 2009 ) might be arguably broadened as to also include ‘upstream ’public appraisal of socio-technical assump- tions guiding innovations and their safeties (Sykes and Macnaghten 2013 ).","Aware of that lack of re ﬂexivity, inclusivity and precision surrounding the justi ﬁ- cation and promotion of strategic technological innovations, the EC is currentlyclaiming the adoption of a ‘Responsible Research and Innovation ’(RRI) approach for R&D activities under the next EU Framework Programme ‘Horizon 2020 ’ (2014 –2020), which would ‘allow all societal actors (...) to work together during the whole research and innovation process in order to better align both the process and its outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of European society ’(EC 2013 , 4)",no,,,
From objective to constituted risk - An alternative approach to safety in strategic technological innovation in the European Union.txt,"In contrast to this vision, Iclaim that the relationship between risk and society is ‘constitutive ’: socio-technical safety is constituted according to a set of socio-economic factors and dynamics by which certain techno-industrial safety scenarios are erected while others are not. Taking as a main example the ‘safe and responsible ’development of nanotech- nology in the EU (EC 2004 , 3), I argue that nanosafety is regulated in Europe under the framework of a strong institutional commitment to nanotechnology, by whichthe controllability of the environmental and health risks of nanotechnology in a con-text of a highly competitive knowledge-based global economy is assumed on princi-ple. An appraisal of the economic imperatives grounding technological innovationsas well as of the scienti ﬁc and technical resources and capabilities by which those imperatives are argued to be safely ‘satisﬁable ’would facilitate the creation of alter- native safety scenarios for techno-industrial progress. Seeing techno-industrial riskas‘constituted risk ’implies approaching the risks of techno-industrial progress on a more critical basis. Far from understanding risk governance as an objectively grounded process by which techno-industrial progress should be regulated while avoiding the in ﬂuence of subjective ‘overreactions ’(Sunstein and Zeckhauser 2011 ), it may be argued that risk constitution –including the scienti ﬁc and technical capabilities by which risks can be known and controlled –should be debated on grounds of political, economic and cultural considerations.",An appraisal of the economic imperatives grounding technological innovationsas well as of the scienti ﬁc and technical resources and capabilities by which those imperatives are argued to be safely ‘satisﬁable ’would facilitate the creation of alter- native safety scenarios for techno-industrial progress,no,,,

What these  intellectual traditions have shown is that while the  negative effects of technological innovations may  be unprecedented, they can be foreseen, and, more  importantly, mitigated through more intentional and  skillful engineering. Nevertheless, systematic efforts  to address these impacts remain peripheral to the  engineering profession, with technological artifacts  deemed value-neutral, and intervention often seen  as luddite and unenforceable [1].

In the absence of a robust  carbon price, markets do not internalise the price of carbon emissions,  and this reduces the incentives to invest in clean alternatives. Further,  markets do not fully capture the societal co-benefits associated with  decarbonisation via cleaner air, improved natural capital and related  health benefits which in turn have positive economic impacts via, for  example, a healthier and more productive workforce. Around the world  air pollution contributes to many millions of deaths per year (World  Health Organisation, 2020 ) with much of that pollution coming from the  burning of fossil fuels. But even if the prices were right, strong inertia  and path dependence in innovation systems make it difficult to shift  from dirty to clean technologies quickly, without a strong and coordi - nated enabling package of policies.","Further,  markets do not fully capture the societal co-benefits associated with  decarbonisation via cleaner air, improved natural capital and related  health benefits which in turn have positive economic impacts via, for  example, a healthier and more productive workforce",yes,no,yes,

Building on institutional theory and using multilevel analysis, we ﬁnd that changes in the institutional framework conditions at both national and university levels are conductive to the creation of more spin- offs, but that the increase in quantity is at the expense of the quality of these ﬁrms.

In the following, this company is referred to as Beta. In the media, Beta argued that the main reason for their bankruptcy was significant product development spending, which did not produce desired results, in terms ofsignificant improvement of revenues and profits. This appears to be an accurate analysis as the company ’s revenues were significantly declining (from year 2010 by some 60 per cent), while other expenses in profit and loss statement continued toincrease (by approximately 40 per cent from year 2008), and in terms of assets, the totalamount of R&D expenditure increased significantly.

Nature-inspired innovation policy - Biomimicry as a pathway to leverage biodiversity for economic development..txt,"This paper, therefore, investigates the relevance of  biomimicry in the formulation of sustainable development strategies in biodiverse developing countries and  maps out the national policy landscapes that can advance it.  Several findings arise from this study. First, despite the exponential growth of biomimicry as a field and our  understanding of its economic impact, what drives nature-inspired innovation remains elusive. Second, the  biomimicry innovation landscape is dominated by industrialised economies that have relied on proactive policy  interventions, while virtually no developing country has adopted biomimicry as an innovation strategy,  consolidating the exploitation of the biodiversity in the developing world by firms in high-income nations. Third,  by drawing on empirical evidence from a selection of Latin American countries, this paper shows that while  biomimicry presents tremendous opportunities to leapfrog towards high value-added knowledge-intensive ac- tivities by using local biodiversity and related expertise as factor endowments, policy, and institutional factors  have led to the persistence of important coordination failures that hinder the expansion and commercialization of  biomimicry-based R&D.","First, despite the exponential growth of biomimicry as a field and our  understanding of its economic impact, what drives nature-inspired innovation remains elusive",no,,,
Nature-inspired innovation policy - Biomimicry as a pathway to leverage biodiversity for economic development..txt,"In the 1930s, Joseph Schumpeter had already made  the distinction between mere growth and structural economic change.  He argued that economic development is based on transfers of capital  from one sector to another utilizing new technologies and innovative  methods (Shapiro and Taylor, 1990 ). Aghion and Howitt (1990) later  also explained how technological innovations influence economic  growth by making use of Schumpeter ’s concept of creative destruction,  the competitive process whereby entrepreneurs constantly seek new  ideas that will render their rivals ’ ideas obsolete. More recently, several  scholars (such as Eichengreen et al., 2013 ; and Lee, 2013 ) have also  argued and demonstrated that innovation capabilities are the key  binding constraint for escaping the middle-income trap. This view is also  consistent with the notion that middle-income economies would tend to  fall under a trap because they get caught between low-wage manufac - turers and high-wage innovators; their wage rates are too high to  compete with low-wage exporters and the level of their technological  capability is too low to enable them to compete with ‘advanced ’  industrialised economies (World Bank, 2010 ).","Aghion and Howitt (1990) later  also explained how technological innovations influence economic  growth by making use of Schumpeter ’s concept of creative destruction,  the competitive process whereby entrepreneurs constantly seek new  ideas that will render their rivals ’ ideas obsolete",yes,yes,yes,"""Aghion and Howitt (1990) later  also explained how technological innovations influence economic  growth by making use of Schumpeter ’s concept of creative destruction,  the competitive process whereby entrepreneurs constantly seek new  ideas that will render their rivals ’ ideas obsolete."""

Moreover, we provide a methodological structure, concerning methodologiesand research purpose behind papers. Literature mainly agrees about PSS bene ﬁts, barriers, and partly also on drivers, but from the descriptive and thematic analysis what emerged is a lack of clarity about PSS and its main ﬁelds: it started as a topic closely connected with sustainability, but subsequently different ﬁelds have developed other terminologies and focuses of research, developing their own theoretical base and frameworks.",Moving from the analysis of literature we provide a conceptual structure depicting the current situ- ation of literature dealing with the analysis of economic impact and environmental/social impact of Product Service System,no,,,

Then, the two pools are joined in a single graph. Expressing both environmental and economic impact as a vector, and adding together all the activity vectors, it is possible to obtain a single vector (called E2 vector eEconomic and Environmental) that summarizes in a single datum all the environmental and economic performances of PSS. In his work, Tukker (2004) deﬁnes eight different types of PSS deriving from his categorisation, and analyses them ﬁrst of all un- der the economic/competitiveness aspect, evaluating for each of these types: market value for users, costs for provider, capital needs, and the ability to sustain value in the future. Then, for each type, the author evaluates the environmental/social potential in terms of impact reduction, considering mechanisms with incre- mental impact reduction (i.e.","Expressing both environmental and economic impact as a vector, and adding together all the activity vectors, it is possible to obtain a single vector (called E2 vector eEconomic and Environmental) that summarizes in a single datum all the environmental and economic performances of PSS",no,,,

Productivity and Broadband - The Human Factor..txt,"This is primarily because advanced societies have increasingly evolved toward what has been called a ‘‘knowledge-based economy’’ (OECD 2006), whereby human capital is seen to be a crucial feature of economic growth (Faggian and McCann 2009a). Since the mid-1980s, the externalities related to education and human capital have been included as key variables in models of endogenous economic growth (Romer 1986; Lucas 1988; Krugman 1991) in order to explicitly recognize the link between these externalities and higher levels of growth (Acs 2004). In fact, several studies have found positive economic impacts related to the level of human capital within regions (Rauch 1993; Glaeser, Scheinkman, and Shleifer 1995; Simon and Nardinelli 1996, 2002; Faggian and McCann 2009b). Aside from the general impor- tance of human capital to regional economies, the evolution of the economy in recent decades from a manufacturing to a services-oriented economy has placed increased importance on the role of human capital in the economic competitiveness of cities, regions, and nations (Lloyd and Clark 2001). Not only is human capital alone important for regional economic development, but the literature on ICTs also suggests that human capital plays a key role in the adoption and subsequent impacts of these technologies (Benhabib and Spiegel 1994).","In fact, several studies have found positive economic impacts related to the level of human capital within regions (Rauch 1993; Glaeser, Scheinkman, and Shleifer 1995; Simon and Nardinelli 1996, 2002; Faggian and McCann 2009b)",no,,,

Applying  the SbD principle at later stages is still possible but may require a  modification of the existing NM/NEP and/or processes to make it safer,  which can (sometimes) be more costly than if applied at ealier stages. In  addition, when a prototype is already available, a preliminary human  and environmental RA may be required to identify and prioritize risks  and decide on appropriate SbD measures.","As the project progresses and more information on  the NM/NEP becomes available, more complete and comprehensive  studies related to risk assessment (RA), life cycle assessment (LCA) and  socio-economic impact assessment (SEA) can be carried out",no,,,

"Science, innovation, and public services - editorial introduction..txt","In our perspective, there was fundamental ine ﬃciency in earlier EO research related to the gap between the wide opportunities o ﬀered by the free availability of the data and their actual use. According to Tassa ( 2019 ) initially the pioneering applications of EO were developed and re ﬁned mostly within a relatively restricted community of scientists and specialists. But the true challenge was how to spread the applications with a potential socio-economic impact. Only when a political strategic decision was made at an EU level with the Lisbon Treaty (2007) to create a European Space Policy, and more recently with the inclusion of Copernicus in the EU regular budget (2014), was there a change of pace and actual use growth was sustained. This example clearly shows one of the most important points in the discussion in the previous section: while in some cases there may be informal mechanisms ensuring permeability between science and R&D for its application to public services, only a mission-oriented public policy can bridge the gap between the two worlds.",But the true challenge was how to spread the applications with a potential socio-economic impact,no,,,
Strategic embeddedness of modularity in alliances - Innovation and performance implications..txt,"This paper examines whether modular product structures within alliances might moderate the weak spots that characterize alliances and thereby improve product innovation and competitive performance. An innovation strategy sets strategic targets and helps streamline activ- ities within the ﬁrm; modular product structures specify products as bundles of components that offer recombination potential for leverag- ing distributed, ongoing product innovation ( Sanchez, 1995 ). Prior re- search in operations management and new product development highlights the advantages of modular product structures for alliance ﬁrms, including facilitating parallel, decentralized product innovation processes ( Galunic & Eisenhardt, 2001 ) and component re- combinations that generate new outputs without needing new compo-nent designs ( Sanchez & Mahoney, 1996 ).Yet extant literature offers little insight about modularity within alliances ( Lau, Tang, & Yam, 2010 ), even though product innovation per- formance requires coordinated innovation activities across ﬁrms (Howard & Squire, 2007 ). By drawing on modularit yc o n c e p t u a l i z a t i o n s , the present study investigates how modular product structures improve ﬁrms' speed to market, radical innovation, and competitive performance. After establishing the role of a ﬁrm's innovation strategy, this study con- siders the moderating effect of that innovation strategy on the relation- ship between modular product structures in the alliance and performance.","Prior re- search in operations management and new product development highlights the advantages of modular product structures for alliance ﬁrms, including facilitating parallel, decentralized product innovation processes ( Galunic & Eisenhardt, 2001 ) and component re- combinations that generate new outputs without needing new compo-nent designs ( Sanchez & Mahoney, 1996 ).Yet extant literature offers little insight about modularity within alliances ( Lau, Tang, & Yam, 2010 ), even though product innovation per- formance requires coordinated innovation activities across ﬁrms (Howard & Squire, 2007 )",yes,yes,no,

The evidence shows that in the short run, it is difficult to obtain economicgains from circular economy related innovations when taken in isolation, especially for Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), who may also experience negative returns.","This assessment is one of the goals of the current work, which tries to provide new empir-ical evidence on the economic returns of circular economy practices, drawing on pre- vious literature on the underlying determinants of greener production choices, which are stated to differ from standard technological innovations as they are subject to a knowledge and an environmental externality",no,,,

Indeed, several scenarios may emerge, for example, in theaftermath of CE innovation adoption, increasing revenues may be off- set by increasing costs, increasing revenues may be associated with decreasing costs (the best scenario for a firm) or, again, mixed scenar-ios may be revealed by the analysis. A first way to empirically assess the potential economic impact of CE strategies is to perform a sample ttest on group differences on different outcome variables. The ttest compares the difference in the means of the selected economic log-transformed revenues (revenues per employee) and costs (costs of production peremployee) variables of the two groups: One group belongs to thosefirms having introduced a certain CE innovation, and the other group belongs to those firms that have not introduced such innovations.

Scenario Design The Porter hypothesis is an important issue related to carbon constraint. The weak version of the hypothesis describes how appropriate environmental regulations will stim- ulate technological innovation, while the strong version expresses that environmental regulation positively affects total factor productivity (TFP) or business performance by stimulating technological innovation. This paper focuses on TFP to test the boundary of the Porter hypothesis rather than green productivity, such as in many papers [ 61] because the deﬁnition of the strong version of the hypothesis is productivity.

The process of carbon neutrality will signiﬁcantly increase the price of energy-intensive products, such as energy-processing products and steel, and such a process will hardly have a signiﬁcant impact on agriculture and services. According to the strong Porter hypothesis, environmental regulations may lead to technological innovation, thus improving enterprise productivity. In addition, this paper simulates the additional total factor productivity needed to recover the economic loss caused by the carbon neutrality target. The results show that TFP needs to increase by about 0.056% every year from 2020 to 2030 to make up for the economic losses caused by the 2030 carbon peak.","According to the strong Porter hypothesis, environmental regulations may lead to technological innovation, thus improving enterprise productivity",yes,no,no,

The productivity slowdown - is it the 'new normal'..txt,"A  possible resolution of the current productivity paradox may well  entail the timing of the economic effects of technologies which are already visible but have not yet fully matured. VIII. Is the problem not matching the economic impact of  the ‘great inventions’? A possible explanation for the productivity paradox is that there is a great deal of much-noticed innovative activity but it will have only a relatively weak economic impact, i.e. only a modest effect on TFP growth or labour productivity growth. This view has been strongly advocated by Gordon (2016) who argues that the phase of rapid American TFP growth in the twentieth century was based on the ‘great inven-tions’ of the second industrial revolution, that nothing of similar importance is likely in the near future, and that whatever potential new technologies such as robotics have will continue only to be realized slowly so that the rate of productivity growth will not be raised very much.","Is the problem not matching the economic impact of  the ‘great inventions’?

Pessimistic arguments are of two kinds. Either the economic impact of today’s new technologies will be rather weak or, even more ominously, new ideas have become hard to find and the steady-state rate of TFP growth is now very slow by past standards.

The technological evolution of food traceability systems and their impact on firm sustainable performance - A RBV approach..txt,"Effectiveness performance is also enhanced as technological innovations improve physical secondary identi ﬁcation resources activities, such as the validation of traceability identi ﬁers; therefore ensuring that the company stays ahead of competition (e.g., when protecting their brand) [ H3b]. Changes in human routines result in barriers that are costly to copy by others in the market [ H4b]. These results are in line with RBV thinking, supporting the idea that the implementation of technological innovations in human resources is a major source of competitive advantage. It provides evidence to suggest that innovating in technologies that manage product identi ﬁers (e.g., barcodes, RFID) improves ﬁrm sustainable performance. Further, RBV theory suggests that ﬁrst-mover advantages exist for ﬁrms that implement these techno logies before others.","These results are in line with RBV thinking, supporting the idea that the implementation of technological innovations in human resources is a major source of competitive advantage",yes,yes,yes,"""These results are in line with RBV thinking, supporting the idea that the implementation of technological innovations in human resources is a major source of competitive advantage.

Technological innovations in communication technology can affect the market in with ﬁrms operate but they need to constantly improve the way human resources communicate traceability infor- mation to have an impact on ﬁrm ef ﬁciency performance. Regulation has little space to encourage innovations in communication technol- ogy as ﬁrms choose their technologies according to their trajectories or idiosyncratic situations. Regulators need to carefully choose a strategy to work with ﬁrms if they want a certain type of traceability information-sharing capabilities to be developed by companies (Garcia Martinez et al., 2007 ).",Technological innovations in communication technology can affect the market in with ﬁrms operate but they need to constantly improve the way human resources communicate traceability infor- mation to have an impact on ﬁrm ef ﬁciency performance,yes,yes,yes,Technological innovations in communication technology can affect the market in with ﬁrms operate but they need to constantly improve the way human resources communicate traceability infor- mation to have an impact on ﬁrm ef ﬁciency performance.
Understanding and managing product lifetimes in support of a circular economy.txt,"As a research ﬁeld, it has however not received much attention. The collection of 24 papers was partly drawn from the PLATE 2017 conference (Product Lifetimes and the Environment), November 2017 in Delft, the Netherlands. This special issue introductory article providesan overview of the content of the articles, divided into three topics: product design in a circular economy, circular business models, and environmental &economic impact assessment. One of the overall ﬁndings is that there is a lack of empirical validation and critical evaluation of many of the widely-held as-sumptions about design and business model innovation for product lifetime extension. More empirical research is needed in order to build a repertoire of validated approaches, cases, tools and methods, taking into account rebound effects.","This special issue introductory article providesan overview of the content of the articles, divided into three topics: product design in a circular economy, circular business models, and environmental &economic impact assessment",no,,,

Exploring the potential of additive manufacturing for product design in a circulareconomy3D printing or additive manufacturing supports circular design strategies by creating opportunities to extend a product ’s lifespan, for instance by enabling repair or upgrades, even if these products were not originally designed for ease of repair or upgrading. However,the use of monolithic structurally complex parts that support design for recyclability mayhinder high value product recovery. Also, 3D printable materials must be developed thatoffer durable use and reuse.3D printing Tecchio, P., F.","Exploring the potential of additive manufacturing for product design in a circulareconomy3D printing or additive manufacturing supports circular design strategies by creating opportunities to extend a product ’s lifespan, for instance by enabling repair or upgrades, even if these products were not originally designed for ease of repair or upgrading",no,,,
Understanding and managing product lifetimes in support of a circular economy.txt,"They present an analysis of 519 products that are advertised for their durability, length of guar- antee, repair service availability and post-consumer product collec- tion. Among the best practices are long-term guarantees and provisions for repair, whereas post-consumer collection is lagging behind. Similar results are reported by Ertz, Leblanc-Proulx, Sar- ig€ollü, and Morin who ﬁnd that most of the 150 companies in their sample prefer to extend the lives of products already on the market through prolonged use, maintenance, redistribution, repair and remanufacture, instead of making investments in new (long-life) product design. This leads to the central question we identi ﬁed in the introduction: how to create business models that enable prod- ucts to cycle in the inner loops? Whalen describes three archetypical business models that play a role in extending product value, with the aim to assess their resource ef ﬁciency. She distinguishes between facilitators, redis- tributors and doers.","Similar results are reported by Ertz, Leblanc-Proulx, Sar- ig€ollü, and Morin who ﬁnd that most of the 150 companies in their sample prefer to extend the lives of products already on the market through prolonged use, maintenance, redistribution, repair and remanufacture, instead of making investments in new (long-life) product design",no,,,
Understanding and managing product lifetimes in support of a circular economy.txt,"- And ﬁnally, the research on circular economy presented in this special issue contributes to a reinvigoration of sustainability and industrial ecology research, making it relevant for a new gen- eration of researchers and designers. 6. Conclusions In this special issue we set out to address three overarching research questions: How to design for product life extension? How to create business models that enable products to cycle in the inner loops? And, to what extent is product life extension bene- ﬁcial for the environment? Regarding product design one of the lessons is that taken-for- granted design strategies such as personalisation or modularity, may not always work in the messy dynamics of people ’s everyday lives. A second lesson that follows from this, is that in order to truly prolong product lifetimes, understanding consumers or users is crucial, for example through involving them in the (re)design pro- cess. And thirdly, empirical validation of circular design strategies is necessary, both because of potential negative rebound effects as well as potential co-bene ﬁts and spill-over effects of implementing a design strategy in real life.","Conclusions In this special issue we set out to address three overarching research questions: How to design for product life extension?
